Prompt Log Entry
Prompt 1:
"How can I globally reset margins and set a base font and theme in CSS?"

AI Response Summary:
The AI responded and suggested to use a universal * selector to reset margin, padding, and set box-sizing: border-box. The AI also responded to set font-family, background-color, and color in the body.

My Implementation:
I used * { margin: 0; padding: 0; box-sizing: border-box; } and defined a base font and theme for the project in the body.

Reflection:
It helped create a consistent starting point across all browsers. Resetting margin/padding helped eliminate layout inconsistencies.



Prompt 2:
"How can I style a responsive header with navigation links using Flexbox?"

AI Response Summary:
Recommended using a display of flex, justify-content: space-between, and align-items: center for layout. Spacing for and hover effects for navigation links were also covered.

My Implementation:
I applied flex styling to the header, used padding for spacing, and added transition effects and hover color changes to the navigation links.

Reflection:
Resulted in a clean, modern look. The flexbox made handling layout very intuitive, especially when adapting to screen width.



Prompt 3:
"Whatâ€™s the best way to create a hero section with bold typography and a call-to-action button?"

AI Response Summary:
Use gradients for the background, center text, and padding for spacing. Take some time to think about the contrast of the button with the text, and changes on hover.

My Implementation:
I added a .hero section with a gradient background, styled headings and paragraph, and created a white button with hover feedback.

Reflection:
The hero section works well. I am happy with how it looks on desktop and mobile, with only minor adjustments to font sizes.



Prompt 4:
"How can I layout product cards responsively with hover effects?"

AI Response Summary:
Recommended that I use display: flex with flex-wrap: wrap and apply justify-content: center. It also suggested I used transform and box-shadow for hover.

My Implementation:
I used a .products class with flex display and spacing, and a .product-card class with hover animations. I added padding, font styling, and responsive images.

Reflection:
The cards are clean, interactive, and responsive. I think that the hover effect is a huge improvement for visual feedback.



Prompt 5:
"How do I make my layout responsive using CSS media queries?"

AI Response Summary:
Recommends @media queries with breakpoints (768px, etc.). Also suggests stacking flex items, resizing text, and adjusting padding for smaller screens.

My Implementation:
Applied @media (max-width: 768px) for a mobile adjustment of the header, products, and .hero text sizes.

Reflection:
The changes made for responsive sites has improved usability on phones and tablets a lot.
Also, managing the media queries was easier than I thought it would be.
